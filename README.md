Gene Regulatory Network Reconstruction based on a Hybridization of RNN and Half Systems

A gene regulatory network maps the regulatory interactions between genes, at a particular condition of the human body. The reconstruction of such networks from time-series
genetic expression data using computational tools is a challenge for contemporary computer scientists.
In the last years, several models have been proposed for the inference of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data, unfortunately, the computational methods produce
many false predictions along with the correct predictions, which is unwanted. These two hybridized approaches attempts to decrease the number of false predictions, thereby increase the specificity of the proposed models.
To train the parameters of the RNN and HS models, Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is used.
